symbols: - suggestion, *done, !rejected, --comment

-*rinc in Java_org_rin_main: use something different for argv|done

-*controlls, for now does nothing|done


-*make all bautifull types (intxx_t... |done
-*make sure all there is no signed where a unsinged should be |needs checking - otherwise done

-*decide on ose of fopen or open|done

-*important: correct file paths instead of ms0 , disk and stuff|done

-*jni, sound and graphcis bufferinga and rendering/home/kaspar/dev/workspace/rin/jni/filer.c:1301: undefined reference to `add_entry_pl'
/home/kaspar/dev/workspace/rin/jni/filer.c:1297: undefined reference to `add_entry_pl'|done

-*important:  gb.c:34 set correct adress for vframe (ie bitmap pixels) - better use pg instead of accessing the framebuffer directly|  done dont use use_pgu 

-*proper exception handling --jni can throw exceptions -make a little api to throw exceptions |deprecated, not sure if thats necessary and intelligent, rely on other feedback mechanisms

-*investigate what pgbitblitge does (it does hw accelerated bit blitting) and how you can replace it (use existing bi blitting functions or write a new one) | done - dont use gpu functions for now, maybe use later if it makes any sense (prolly not since not all devices have a good gpu, open gl support seems difficult to handle and is not in all andoroid versions present)

-*remove all handwritten screensizes and positioning stuff and replace it with preprocessor variables or variables|deprecated

-*more meaningfull names for gameboy and target screen sizes (instead of SIZELINE, LINE_SIZE...)-> replace GUARD_LINE with GGUARD_LINE, SIZE_LINE with GLINE_SIZE, LINESIZE with LINE_SIZE and SIZE_COLUMN with GCOLUMN_SIZE

-*landscape mode and portrait change handling

-*get audio start stop and  app termination finally working 100%

-*adjust screen size

-*introduce blitt function with variable screen size and format for simplicity and easier adjustment for new targets/screenmodes

-*rewind function

-*remove USE_GPU directive

-*implement sleep mode - mode when unit is locked and no rendering shold be done

-*get rid of fucking audiotrack bugs and sync issues

-*proper pause/unpause acitivity backgound - termination shit

-*fix memory leaks

-*!config save (in native) crashes, delete and dont use it or repair it?

-*save custom palette: local or global? -> use two, one local and one global

-*do color conversion directly when writing to gameboy framebuffer in lcd.c -- only workd for bitblidbilingrid for now -- but good framerate increase in debug.

-*improve audio latency: just use two soundbanks (posibly smaller) -- only works when running renderer_update_sound from the audio thread. Game thread frame rate doesnt seem high enough. 

-*working bresham image upscaling (try to be fast)

-*some turbo/speed setting functionality

-!adjustable rewind buffer size

-*setting handdling, decide on default settings etc...

-!adjustable audio buffer size?

-!leave button detection on controlls to avoid glitch where button remains pressed, not sure if performancewise this is efficiently doable or if it would be a cool feature, maybe make it an? implementation idea: use fastest map (hasmap) in java and keep track of pointers -- keep it as a feature

-*finish menu

-password for release: homer55
-passowrd for release key: homer47

-*some autosave functionality: customizable in menu?

-*correct bilinearGrid

-!move size calculation of view dimensions backwards in order to be able to use layout dimensions isntead of screen dimensions (might not be possible without too much hassle)
  --not necessary for now

-*cleanup: - partially done 
	- *get rid old menu files (menu.c and menu.h)
	- *cleanup savelaod.c
	- *pg.c 
	- *graphics.c
	- *image.c
	- *utils.c
	- *gz.c, filer.c -- remove draw rom progress

-*add scroll to various textviews (help, about) that thei are scrollable on small displays
-*fix spacing of palette on small displays

-*back key in filebrowsing

-*remove logcalls

-*do something for devices without sdcard, that is to say dont use hardcoded sdcard but something like externalstoragedirectory

-!integrate directory up button into filebrowser instead of ../ -- no confusion --> add string indicating the function instead for simplicity, binsize and consistency

-*associate file endigs with activity and toogleable automove roms to /sdcard/rin

-*libraries: provide mips, x68, and arm 
  -build unziplib against libz to save space
  -strip all libraries?

-*build performancecriticall code also against armv7a and armv7a-neon (provide optimal compiler flags) -> use libpreloadcheck.so 
-*better image buttonsn for high dpi

-adjust ui for various screens:
	- screenconfigurations that are not ideal:
	   -generally high resolution and low dp. 
	- *portrait mode: couple start and select button to the cross or to the A,B- buttons to ensure the user can reach them with the thumb on low dp displays
	- *landscape mode: align gbcross and A,B- buttons to the bottom instead of so the user can doesnt have can hold his device comfortable.
	- *find a way to center the rinview, especially on big displays
	- option to stretch rinview to availaible space ?

----------------------------------------release 1.0--------------------------------------------------------
-direction button indicator
-cheat support
-compressed rom loading, compressed state saving and  loading

-*use lodepng instead of libpng because of size

-opengl render path and scaling

-somehow integrate even- numbered scalefactors to profit from faster scaling possibilities (ie copy 5 pixels at once)
-allow smaller emulatio screens




after initial release: 
-(irda?) -- long term goal -- implement somekind of network interaction
