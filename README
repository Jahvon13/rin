This is an android app to emulate gameboy roms. Supported are the normal gameboy, 
super gameboy and gameboy color roms. The emulatorcore is based on the rin- gameboy emulator
for psp.

Minimum api version is 8 because of jnigraphics. Support for Opengles renderpath might be added
in the future that would allow to target lower api levels.

All of the code is under the GPLv2 and later license.
